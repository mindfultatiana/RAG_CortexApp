# RAG_CortexApp
The Snowflake BUILD Bootcamp Day Two Project
The project was based off this [Quickstart](https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/ask_questions_to_your_own_documents_with_snowflake_cortex_search/index.html?index=../..index#0)

I built a RAG based chatbot that parsed pdfs for usable text chunks that answered questions in natural language. It also had the option to answer the questions with a variet of different AIs like Llamas3.

## Database Structure
I built the data warehouse, database, and schema structure with a SQL Worksheet script

## Launch with Streamlit
I worked with Streamlit in Snowflake to deploy it and change the code to RagCortexApp.py
